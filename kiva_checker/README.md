# Kiva Notifier

Lambda that runs weekly to query the Kiva API to see if there
are any countries I haven't lent to yet that have loans available,
and emails me if there are.

Manually created Lambda & SNS topic, if we use this more then consider
getting that infrastructure documented.

1/5/21 moved it to this repo except for the SNS topic.
